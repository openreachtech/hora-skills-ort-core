# Branches

Conventions for the branches a repository carries. Referenced from `SKILL.md`.

## The trunk branch

A **trunk branch** is one that other branches are cut from and merged back into.

Four are trunks by name, in every repository.

| branch | what it carries |
| :-- | :-- |
| `main` | the mainline every other branch descends from |
| `release/x.x.x` | one version's work, until it merges into `main` |
| `dev` | long-lived integration |
| `env` | the initial environment setup |

**Every other branch is a general branch, and takes the role rather than holding it.** A
general branch behaves as a trunk for as long as work is split off it. The four above behave as
trunks whether anything is outstanding against them or not.

The shape of the name settles nothing. `release/x.x.x` is a trunk and
`retake/save-of-UserRepository` is not, and the two are the same shape.

- **Trunks nest.** A general branch cut from `main` that then has work split off it is both: a
  sub-branch of `main`, and the trunk of what it carries. The role is held against a particular
  branch, never held outright.
  - **Each half brings its own obligations, and neither cancels the other.** Being a trunk, the
    branch opens with the `Start …` marker described in `SKILL.md`; being a sub-branch, it
    merges back into `main` once it is done. That the merge is made locally, with no pull
    request to open early, takes nothing away from the marker.
- **A sub-branch merges back into its trunk, and a trunk never merges into what it carries.**
  The direction is the same at every level of the nesting.
- **A trunk is where work arrives, not where work is done.** Nothing is committed to a trunk
  directly: cut a branch for the change, commit it there, and merge it back. This holds for a
  general branch from the moment it takes the role, and it holds on a trunk whose only commit so
  far is its own opening marker — a trunk with nothing on it yet is still not a place to work.
  - The exceptions are the two commits a trunk makes about itself rather than about the work:
    the marker that opens it, and the `Merge …` commit that brings a sub-branch in. Both are
    described in `SKILL.md`, and neither carries a change of its own.

## Naming a general branch

A general branch is named `<verb | category>/xxxx`. Before the slash goes a verb for what the
branch does, or a category for what kind of work it is; after it, the name is free — an
identifier may appear verbatim.

```
declare/AlphaClass
define/sendMessage-of-AlphaClass
rename/FormElementClerk
fix/type-errors-reported-by-the-client-package
install/date-fns-4.1.0
tidyup/the-environment-files
```

**The name is written for whoever scans `git branch` while the work is still in flight**, so it
is deliberately descriptive. Nothing reads it after the branch is gone.

- **The verb is the word the branch's own commits would use, lowercased.** `Declare` names a
  class and `Define` names a member, a function or a constant, which is why
  `declare/AlphaClass` and `define/sendMessage-of-AlphaClass` say what they carry without any
  further explanation. The verbs are listed in `SKILL.md`.
  - **A verb of two words joins into one, with no hyphen** — `Tidy up` gives `tidyup/xxxx`,
    `Kick out` gives `kickout/xxxx`, `Turn off` gives `turnoff/xxxx`. The slash ends the token,
    so nothing inside it has to.
- **A member is written `<member>-of-<class>`.** The slash is already spent on the verb, so what
  is left spells the relation out instead of punctuating it.
- **Work of a scale that will make the branch a trunk takes a category at a higher level of
  abstraction** — `implement/xxx`, `setup/xxx`, `feature/xxx`, `retake/xxx`, `update/xxx`. A
  branch that is about to have six branches cut from it cannot be named for one narrow verb
  without lying about five of them.
- **A sub-branch cut from a general branch acting as a trunk is named the same way**, and the
  nesting adds no constraint of its own: `<verb | category>/xxxx`, free. The narrow verbs
  belong here, where each branch really does carry one thing.

## Merging back into a trunk

- **Always `--no-ff`, never fast-forward.** A fast-forward leaves no commit a human can point
  at: the branch's commits are strung onto the trunk's line, and the fact that they arrived
  together, as one piece of work, stops being visible at all.
- **Delete the branch once it is merged.** Its name was written for whoever watched the work in
  flight, and that reader is gone. This includes a trunk that merges into another trunk —
  `dev` and `env` are deleted once they land on `main`.
  - **A trunk kept alive after it merged sits at the past of the trunk it merged into**, and
    everything cut from it afterwards inherits that. Merging `origin/main` back in would
    settle it, but re-cutting the branch settles the same thing without leaving a merge commit
    that carries no work of its own:

    ```bash
    git branch -d dev
    git switch -C dev origin/main
    ```
- **When two branches were cut from the same commit on a trunk, whichever merges second rebases
  onto the trunk's new tip first.** The second branch then merges into the trunk as it now
  stands, rather than reopening a line that was already closed.
- **Every rebase in this scheme uses `-r` (`--rebase-merges`).**

  ```bash
  git rebase -r --onto <trunk's new tip> <the commit this branch was cut from> <branch>
  ```

  Without `-r`, `git rebase` drops every merge commit it replays. A branch that carried its own
  sub-branches then arrives flattened, and the `--no-ff` merges inside it are gone — the exact
  thing `--no-ff` was used to keep.
